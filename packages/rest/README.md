The Credo REST API is the most convenient way to get started with Credo in the cloud.

- ⭐ **Endpoints** to work with both DIDComm and OpenID4VC.
- 💻 **CLI** that makes it super easy to start an instance of the REST API.
- 🌐 **Interoperable** with all major Aries implementations.
- 🧑 **Multi-tenant** Use the same agent and server for as many tenants as you want. Each tenant has its own separate encrypted storage.

### Quick start

See the [Credo REST API docs](https://credo.js.org/guides/extensions/rest) for installation instructions.
